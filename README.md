# vim_config
The current vimrc config that I am using.

## Setup
The plugin manager is Vundle so install it here:

[Vundle on Github](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

If you are lazy to go through it just run:

`git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`

Remember to source your .vimrc!

Once you paste the config file into your `.vimrc` run:

`:PluginInstall` 

Done, enjoy!
